# Mathematical
This space is intended for all .cpp files needed to solve a few mathematics problems that I found an interest in. Based on generalised solutions to Project Euler problems.

See Project Euler here: https://projecteuler.net/about 

The programs shown in this repo have been tweaked to solve a slightly more general problem than those they intended to solve in the above link. 

There is also a mini-project "CholeskyDecomposition" which does not use C++ and is not related to Project Euler, and essentially is a VBA code file to obtain the Cholesky decomposition of a covariance matrix (and thus generate correlated random variables).
