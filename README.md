# Mathematical
This space is intended for all .cpp files needed to solve a few mathematics problems that I found an interest in. Based on generalised solutions to Project Euler problems.

See Project Euler here: https://projecteuler.net/about 

The programs shown in this repo have been tweaked to solve a slightly more general problem than those they intended to solve in the above link.
