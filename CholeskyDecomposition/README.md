When we simulate random uncorrelated random variables (for example, X_1, X_2, ..., X_n iid N(0,1)) we can generate equivalent correlated random variables by multiplying the 
random vector X by the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix containing the correlations.

Based off of the Choleskyâ€“Banachiewicz algorithm, this VBA program computes the Cholesky decomposition of a positive definite symmetric matrix.
